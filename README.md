# What is CrewOS?
CrewOS is an Operating System Simulation, which simulates the installation of an Operating System **WITHOUT** affecting any Data on your PC! Once the Setup Wizard "installs" the operating system, it will open the Operating System Simulation on your PC. 
##### Please Note that the OS itself is not ready, the only file currently included is the Setup Wizard!

All Code is purely ChatGPT generated, the design is supposed to be similar to windows.
